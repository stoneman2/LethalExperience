# LethalExperience
Expand the experience system by adding numbered levels and XP per loot deposited to the ship (Even if you all die)
Added new hud elements on loot deposit and on your pause menu.
You get XP equal to the cost of the scrap.
Levels are scaled by adding 10 more XP required per level.
Go wild and see how far you can go!

This is a clientsided mod. Levels are not shared with anyone, only you can see your own level.
